## Pre-Edit Build Gate [REQUIRED]

Before editing any `.ts` file, run `npm run build` to confirm the project compiles.
After each file edit, re-run `npm run build` before editing the next file.
If the build fails, fix the error before making any further edits.

- Prefer atomic file writes over multiple incremental edits for complex changes
- Always read the target region + surrounding context before editing to ensure unique anchors
- Never leave the project in a broken build state between edits
- Validation: `bash scripts/validate-build.sh` or `npm run build`
